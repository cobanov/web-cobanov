<p>
  This FastAPI application offers text prediction capabilities using a
  pre-trained RoBERTa model. It serves a static HTML page and provides an
  endpoint for generating text predictions in real-time.

  The Fast + Focused App is a web-based application designed to enhance your
  reading speed by displaying words from a text file at a rapid pace. This
  method, often referred to as speed reading, allows users to consume content
  faster by minimizing the eye movement and focusing on central vision. The app
  dynamically reads a text file and displays each word individually at a
  user-defined speed.

<h3>Tasnif</h3>
<b>
  <a href="https://github.com/cobanov/tasnif" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
</b>
<p>
  Tasnif is a Python package designed for clustering images into user-defined
  classes based on their visual content. It utilizes deep learning to generate
  image embeddings, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality
  reduction, and K-means for clustering. Tasnif supports processing on both GPU
  and CPU, making it versatile for different computational environments.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from tasnif import Tasnif

# Initialize Tasnif with 5 classes, PCA dimensions set to 16, and GPU usage
classifier = Tasnif(num_classes=5, pca_dim=16, use_gpu=False)

# Read images from a specified directory
classifier.read('path/to/your/images')

# Calculate embeddings, PCA, and perform clustering
classifier.calculate()

# Export clustered images and grids
classifier.export('path/to/output')</code></pre>

<h3>Localscan</h3>
<b>
  <a href="https://github.com/cobanov/localscan" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
</b>
<p>
  This is a simple network scanner written in Python. It utilizes ARP requests
  to discover devices on a given network and performs a lightweight scan on each
  discovered device using Nmap.
